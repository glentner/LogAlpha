`LogAlpha` is a minimal framework for logging in Python focused on simplicity. It provides only the core
building blocks of a logging system and then gets out of your way. Instead of trying to solve every possible
scenario, this library doesn't even require you log text or that it will be written to a file.

The library provides a set of base classes to build from. On the :ref:`Getting Started <getting_started>`
page you will get a sense of how the library works. A full :ref:`API <api>` reference is included as well.
